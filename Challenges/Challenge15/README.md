# Sum All Odd Fibonacci Numbers

Given a positive integer `num`, return the sum of all odd Fibonacci numbers that are less than or equal to `num`.

The first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 1 and 1. Every additional number in the sequence is the sum of the two previous numbers. The first six numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8.

For example, `sumFibs(10)` should return `10` because all odd Fibonacci numbers less than or equal to `10` are 1, 1, 3, and 5.
