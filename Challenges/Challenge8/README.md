## Challenge description


### Min Stack
Create a Stack that contains the standard push and pop methods. It should also contain another method min that returns the minimum number in the Stack.

#### Extra Credit

All operations should take O(1) time.

#### Example

This is an example of a test case:

```
const stack = new Stack()

stack.push(3)
stack.push(5)
console.log(stack.min())
// => 3

stack.pop
stack.push(7)
console.log(stack.min())
// => 3

stack.push(2)
console.log(stack.min())
// => 2

stack.pop
console.log(stack.min())
// => 3

```
